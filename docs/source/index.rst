py-filelock
===========

*py-filelock* is a single Python module, which implements a platform independent
file lock. The lock is thread safe and easy to use:

.. code-block:: python

    lock = filelock.FileLock("my_lock_file")
    with lock:
        shutil.copy("...", "...")

The lock implements also a counter, which allows you to acquire the lock
multiple times without blocking:

.. code-block:: python

    lock = filelock.FileLock("my_lock_file")

    def update_files1():
        with lock:
            assert lock.is_locked
            # ...
        return None

    def update_files2():
        with lock:
            assert lock.is_locked
            # ...
        return None

    def update_all_files():
        with lock:
            assert lock.is_locked

            update_files1()

            assert lock.is_locked

            update_files2()

            assert lock.is_locked
        assert not lock.is_locked
        return None

    update_all_files()


Installation
------------

This package is listed on PyPi, so you're done with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install filelock


Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    import filelock

    lock = filelock.FileLock("my_lock_file")

    # Simply use the lock into a with statement.
    with lock:
        pass

    # If you want to set a timeout parameter, you can do it by:
    with lock.acquire(timeout = 10):
        pass

    # You can also set a default timeout value, which is used, when no
    # special timeout value is given to the *acquire()* method:
    lock.timeout = 20

    with lock: # 20s timeout
        pass

    with lock.acquire() # 20s timeout
        pass

    with lock.acquire(timeout = 10) # 10s timeout
        pass

    # If you can not use the *with* statement, use a try-finally construct
    # instead:
    try:
        lock.acquire()
    finally:
        lock.release()

    # If you want to use a timeout value, you should consider to catch
    # a Timeout exception:
    try:
        with lock.acquire(timeout = 10):
            pass
    except filelock.Timeout:
        pass

    # Please note, that you can acquire the lock multiple times without
    # blocking. The lock will count, how often it has been acquired and releases
    # the lock, as soon as the counter is 0.
    with lock:
        assert lock.is_locked
        with lock:
            assert lock.is_locked
        assert lock.is_locked
    assert (not lock.is_locked)
